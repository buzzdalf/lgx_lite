# lgx_lite
A place to get the files for my lgx lite bowden mount which I modded from a creation by another user on the Voron discord (I need to find their name for proper credit).

Instructions:
Print the files from the stl file.  
I had to tap the hole in body4 with a m6 tap.
Insert an m3 heat set insert into the end of the 2020 mount.
Attach the 2020 mount to the aluminum extrusion.
Thread a bowden coupling into the m6 hole on Body4.
Attach Body4 to the filament exit path on the lgx lite.
Attach either Body6 or Body13 to the side of the extruder.
Slide the extruder assembly onto the 2020 mount.
Tighten up with an m3 screw.
